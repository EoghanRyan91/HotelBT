# HotelBT, A Mock Hotel Design!
A mock up hotel website I created as a personal project to showcase HTML and CSS skills I have taught myself so far. The website is purely fictional hotel based in Boston, MA. I created this merely as a fun way to test myself and to showcase my self taught skills in writing clean HTML/CSS and website building. Some observations/notes;

<ul>
  <li> Most of my positioning that was achieved via foats is likely much better implemented via CSS Grid/Flex. I have not yet learned about these technologies yet, however once I do, I plan to make more projects to showcase/practice these new skills.</li>
  <li> My stylesheet file became quite large towards the end, given it was for three pages in one sheet. Might be better to create multiple stylesheets to make things easier to read/less scroll intensive? This would create its own issue in making things unnecessarily complicated which may not be the best practice.</li>
  <li>I used semantic HTML tags when necessary as opposed to overusing divs which I learned is a bad practice in writing clean and best functioning HTML. This is something I plan to keep doing and implementing.</li>
</ul>
  
  I plan to keep learning and improving my self taught front end skills, and I am excited to keep learning more and improving. One day I will look back at this site and realise how far I have come, or maybe do a Hotel BT 2.0 with new found skills? Javascript, Grid and Flex are all on my general "to learn" list, so I am excited to keep going.
  
Any feedback or critique on my HTML/CSS writing is very welcomed!
