# Hotel_BT
A mock up hotel website I created as a project to showcase HTML and CSS skills I have taught myself so far. The website is purely fictional and I created this merely as a fun way to test myself and to showcase my self taught skills in writing clean HTML/CSS and website building. Some observations/notes;

<ul>
  <li> Most of my positioning that was achieved via foats is likely much better implemented via CSS Grid/Flex. I have not yet learned about these technologies yet, however once I do, I plan to make more projects to showcase/practice these new skills.</li>
