# HotelBT, A Mock Hotel Design!
A mock up hotel website I created as a personal project to showcase HTML and CSS skills I have taught myself so far. The website is purely fictional hotel based in Boston, MA. I created this merely as a fun way to test myself and to showcase my self taught skills in writing clean HTML/CSS and website building. Some observations/notes;

<ul>
  <li> Most of my positioning that was achieved via foats is likely much better implemented via CSS Grid/Flex. I have not yet learned about these technologies yet, however once I do, I plan to make more projects to showcase/practice these new skills.</li>
  <li>I implemented a lot of utility classes in my CSS which I found very helpful for reapplying to various repeating elements. For example, creating specific CSS styles for button styles or specific link styling came in very handy, as it is much easier to apply a class to an element as opposed to a whole new CSS style for each repeating element; the latter is way more redundant and wasteful which I believe goes against the goal of writing clean code and being minimal.
   <li> I used fontawesome.com for some of the icons, which allowed me to learn about the <script> tag in HTML and importing assets from other sources</li>
  <li> My stylesheet file became quite large towards the end, given it was for three pages in one sheet. Might be better to create multiple stylesheets to make things easier to read/less scroll intensive? This would create its own issue in making things unnecessarily complicated which may not be the best practice.</li>
  <li>I used semantic HTML tags (sections, main, footer, etc) when necessary as opposed to overusing divs which I learned is a bad practice in writing clean and best functioning HTML. This is something I plan to keep doing and implementing.</li>
</ul>
  
  I plan to keep learning and improving my self taught front end skills, and I am excited to keep learning more and improving. One day I will look back at this site and realise how far I have come, or maybe do a Hotel BT 2.0 with new found skills? Javascript, Grid and Flex are all on my general "to learn" list, so I am excited to keep going.
  
Any feedback or critique on my HTML/CSS writing is very welcomed!
