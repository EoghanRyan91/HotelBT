# Hotel_BT
A mock up hotel website I created as a project to showcase HTML and CSS skills I have taught myself so far. The website is purely fictional and I created merely as a fun way to test myself. I have not yet learned flex or grid layouts in CSS so those technologies are not included in this project.
